# Log Parsing Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the "0x03. Log Parsing" project, a part of the ALX curriculum short specialization. The project aims to enhance your Python programming skills, specifically focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time.

## Overview

The project involves reading from standard input (`stdin`), handling data in a specific format, and computing metrics based on the input data. Upon executing the script, metrics such as total file size and the number of lines by status code are calculated and displayed after every 10 lines or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C).
